# Images

Here I publish some Free Software packages that were useful to me at some point. This is primarily a convenience so I can pull them from anywhere I need.

For now there's only OCI containers, but I may add some other types of stuff like VMs in the future. I may also delete or move this repo at any point or stop updating it, so caveat emptor.
